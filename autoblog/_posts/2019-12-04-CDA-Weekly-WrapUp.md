## [Automated and Interpretable Machine Learning](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Educator-Developer-Blog/How-to-make-machine-learning-models-interpretable-A-seminar/ba-p/870819)

**by: Francesca Lazzeri**

1. Automated machine learning is based on a breakthrough from Microsoft’s Research Division. The approach combines ideas from collaborative filtering and Bayesian optimization to search an enormous space of possible machine learning pipelines intelligently and efficiently, serving essentially as a recommender system for machine learning pipelines. On the other hand, when using an algorithm’s outcomes to make high-stakes decisions, it’s important to know which features it did and did not take into account. Additionally, if a model isn’t highly interpretable, the business might not be legally permitted to use its insights to make changes to processes.

2. Conference presentation and blog post.
This was presented at the following conference:
https://www.technologytransfer.eu/event/1831/Machine_Learning_for_the_Enterprise_International_Conference.html -- the related article was published in the blog post linked for this content item.

3. In this talk, Francesca Lazzeri will explain how you can combine automated machine learning and model interpretability to accelerate AI while still making sure that models are highly interpretable, minimizing model risk and making it easy for any enterprise to comply with regulations and best practices.

## [How to tackle the challenges in deploying machine learning models](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/jCAZ38nehxhw1R)

**by: Francesca Lazzeri**

AI offers companies the possibility to transform their operations: from AI applications able to predict and schedule equipment’s maintenance, to intelligent R&D applications able to estimate the success of future drugs, until HR AI-powered tools able to enhance the hiring process and employee retention strategy. However, in order to be able to leverage this opportunity, companies have to learn how to successfully build, train, test, and push hundreds of machine learning models in production, and to move models from development to their production environment in ways that are robust, fast, and repeatable.  

Nowadays data scientists and developers have a much easier experience when building AI-based solutions through the availability and accessibility of data and open-source machine learning frameworks. However, this process becomes a lot more complex when they need to think about model deployment and pick the best strategy to scale up to a production-grade system. 

In this article we will introduce some common challenges of machine learning model deployment and we will discuss the following points in order to enable you to tackle some of those challenges:

1.	Why successful model deployment is fundamental for AI-driven companies
2.	Why companies struggle with model deployment
3.	How to select the right tools to succeed with model deployment
